Kinisi Mecanum Wheels Model 2 (100 mm 10 rollers)
===

Kinisi wheels are mecanum wheels for DIY projects, designed in mind to be easily made at home or in a small shop without any machinery or sophisticated tools. Wheels parts can be made on any 3D printer without any support material and using only popular types of filament.

* Diameter of the wheel: 100mm
* Number of rollers: 10
* Bore diameter: 6mm
* One wheel constructs from 14 printed parts
* Screws assembly

Why this wheels was designe? Main goal is to make low cost and easy to make, available in different sizes and configurations mecanum wheels that can be use in DIY projects.

# Roller axis and mounting screws
In order to make roller axis and mounting screws you need to prepare a 3 feet of low-carbon or carbon steel rod (see material section). Then, you should cut the rod on 10 pieces of length 60mm for roller axes, and 4 pieces of length 46 mm for mounting screws using any steel sow. Then, you should make a small chamfer on both ends of each axis and screws. Finally, make 4mm thread on each side of them using M3 die with die holder, remember to apply thread cutting oil before cutting thread.Watch videos below to see how thread cutting and assembling the wheel can be done.
