You can printed all parts from PLA or ABS except roller tires which you should print from TPU other wise you will not be able to put a tire on a roller core.
There some statistic which I collected while 3d print wheels and parts count:

|-----------------|----------|-------|----------------|--------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Inside          | PLA      | Red   | 44             | 1      | 44              | 312                |

* TPU $31 for 0.8kg

Reaf is not require but preferable for roller cores, and  secondary beans.
